They forced the evacuation and lockdown of Congress, where lawmakers were preparing to approve the election result.

President-elect Biden called on Mr Trump to tell his people to go home and eventually that was the message delivered from the White House.

Washington’s Mayor ordered a curfew as members of the US National Guard were deployed to protect the city.
